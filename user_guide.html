<h1>Welcome to RodRego!</h1>

<p>RodRego is a simple register machine simulator illustrating the computational capabilities of the INC/DEB language model. By inputting different commands, you can increment and decrement the ten registers (or boxes) to simulate different computations.</p>

<p>There are three different commands available: INC, DEB, and END</p>

<p>You can use INC to increment a particular register by one. The syntax for the INC command is: <code>[step] INC [register] [go to step]</code></p>

<p>You can use DEB to decrement a particular register by one. The syntax for the DEB command is: <code>[step] DEB [register] [go to step] [go to step if register already empty]</code></p>
    
<p>Finally, you can use the END command to end a script from running.</p>

<p>An example script might look like:</p>
<pre><code>1 INC 2 2    # Increment 2nd register
2 DEB 3 2 3  # Decrement 3rd register and repeat until empty
3 END        # End program</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, you can comment a line of your script by using '#'. Anything after a '#'' will be ignored.</p>

<p>The order and number of your steps also don't matter, as long as they being on step #1 and create a full stream (you can go from one to the other). For example, you could have the following script:</p>
<pre></code>1  INC 2 8      # Increment 2nd register, go to step 8
98 DEB 5 42 42  # Decrement 5th register, go to step 42
42 END          # End program
8  INC 3 98     # Increment 3rd register, go to step 98</code></pre>

<p>For example scripts, try out the included samples. For more information about RodRego and register machines, read "Secrets of Computer Power Revealed‚Äù[Link to be included]. If you read through it, and do the exercises, you will be a master of register machines in no time.</p>

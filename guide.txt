Welcome to RodRego!

RodRego is a simple register machine simulator illustrating the computational capabilities of the INC/DEB language model. By inputting different commands, you can increment and decrement the ten registers (or boxes) to simulate different computations.

There are three different commands available: INC, DEB, and END

You can use INC to increment a particular register by one. The syntax for the INC command is: [step] INC [register] [go to step]

You can use DEB to decrement a particular register by one. The syntax for the DEB command is: [step] DEB [register] [go to step] [go to step if register already empty]

Finally, you can use the END command to end a script from running.

An example script might look like:
1 INC 2 2    # Increment 2nd register
2 DEB 3 2 3  # Decrement 3rd register and repeat until empty
3 END        # End program

As you can see, you can comment a line of your script by using '#'. Anything after a '#'' will be ignored.

The order and number of your steps also don't matter, as long as they being on step #1 and create a full stream (you can go from one to the other). For example, you could have the following script:
1  INC 2 8      # Increment 2nd register, go to step 8
98 DEB 5 42 42  # Decrement 5th register, go to step 42
42 END          # End program
8  INC 3 98     # Increment 3rd register, go to step 98

For example scripts, try out the included samples. For more information about RodRego and register machines, read "Secrets of Computer Power Revealed‚Äù[Link to be included]. If you read through it, and do the exercises, you will be a master of register machines in no time.
